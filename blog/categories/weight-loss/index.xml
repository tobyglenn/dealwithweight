      <description>article.single .thumb { height: 27rem; }  Beginning of Week number two of the nutrition solutions challange. So far my weight is the same but my muscle amount is increasing. I felt great in week 1 but I am eating 5 nutrition solutions meals a day (not 4 as you are supposed to do 1 breakfest and 3 dinners). I&amp;rsquo;m easing into the decreased amount of calories and fueling my body for the additional workouts.</description>

      <description>I entered the nutrition solutions 6 week challange on last Saturday. My weight was around 200lbs. I was bulking up to try to see if I could go up to 205&amp;frasl;210 division in BJJ. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the way I look at that weight and decided to give nutrition solutions a try (meal prep service) to shed the weight back off in the next 6 weeks. Video:
